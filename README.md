## Introduction

Wolfram's elementary cellular automaton is a simple yet powerful computational model that demonstrates complex patterns emerging from simple rules. This Python project allows you to experiment with different rulesets, visualize the automaton's evolution, and explore various patterns.

## Features

- Generate and visualize patterns using different rulesets.
- Adjustable grid size and initial configurations.
- Slow-drawing mode for observing automaton evolution.
- Easy-to-use Python interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)

You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
